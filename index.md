## About Me
<div id="about-me"></div>

Hello! I am currently a student at Whitman College studying Computer Science. I will graduate this May and I am excited to enter the post-grad world!

## Data Sources and Project Ideas
<div id="data-sources"></div>

[Electrical Vehicle Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data)

This dataset contains information about all battery powered and plug-in hybrid vehicles that are currently registered in Washington State. This information includes vehicle make, model, year, and electric range. There is also data about the location of each registered vehicle.

[Highly Capable Student Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2024-school-year-highly-capable-data)

The Highly Capable Program is an accelerated learning program for eligible students in Washington State. This dataset provides a comparison of the demographics of highly capable students to those of the general student population. Some of the demographic data includes race, ethnicity, income, and disability. The data is specifically for 2024, and is grouped by school, district, and state totals.

[Crime Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/washington-state-uniform-crime-reporting-summary-reporting-system)


[Fish Harvest Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/washington-anadromous-fish-harvest-data-1974-2012)

This dataset provides salmon harvest counts from 1974-2012. For each year, the counts are placed into one of the three following categories: treaty, commercial, or sport fishing. Counts are also divided by species.

## Where's Schueller??
<div id="wheres-schueller"></div>

For this project, we wanted to explore how often Professor Schueller supports Whitman tennis. The map below displays every time Professor Schueller attended a tennis match in 2022 and 2023.
